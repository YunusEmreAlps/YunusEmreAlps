I solve problems in creative ways. At Konya NEU, where I am completing my junior year in the College of Engineering, I have learned the importance of applying classical strategies to modern-day projects. Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionate about solving. This passion carried me through my education process.

A few years ago I realized that I wanted to focus my efforts on being useful. For this reason, I'm trying to contribute more and more to open-source projects, helping people on Discus, StackOverflow, Spectrum, Github discussions... and creating useful content to be used by developers: libraries and articles.
